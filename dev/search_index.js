The format originated with the Eclipse reservoir simulator produced by SLB and is now used by many reservoir simulators. The most useful publicly available description of one such dialect is found in the OPM Flow manual.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"parse_data_file","category":"page"},{"location":"#GeoEnergyIO.InputParser.parse_data_file","page":"Home","title":"GeoEnergyIO.InputParser.parse_data_file","text":"parse_data_file(filename; units = :si)\nparse_data_file(filename; units = :field)\ndata = parse_data_file(\"MY_MODEL.DATA\")\n\nParse a .DATA file given by the path in filename (industry standard input file) into a Dict with String keys. Units will be converted to strict SI unless you pass an alternative unit system like units = :field. Setting units = nothing will skip unit conversion. Note that the simulators in JutulDarcy.jl assumes that the unit system is internally consistent. It is highly recommended to parse to the SI units if you want to perform simulations with JutulDarcy.jl.\n\nThe best publicly available documentation on this format is available from the Open Porous Media (OPM) project's webpages: OPM Flow manual .\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nwarn_parsing=true: Produce a warning when keywords are not supported (or partially supported) by the parser.\nwarn_feature=true: Produce a warning when keywords are supported, but have limited or missing support in the numerical solvers in JutulDarcy.jl.\nunits=:si: Symbol that indicates the unit system to be used in the output. Setting this to nothing will return values without conversion, i.e. exactly what is in the input files. :si will use strict SI. Other alternatives are :field and :metric. :lab is currently unsupported.\nverbose=false: Produce verbose output about parsing progress. For larger files, a lot of output will be generated. Useful when figuring out where a parser fails or spends a lot of time.\n\nNote\n\nThis function only covers a small portion of the keywords that exist for various simulators. You will get warnings that indicate the level of support for keywords in both the parser and the numerical solvers when known keywords with limited support. Pull requests for new keywords are welcome!\n\nThe SUMMARY section is skipped due to the large volume of available keywords that are not essential to define simulation cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Parsing-and-processing-of-corner-point-grids","page":"Home","title":"Parsing and processing of corner-point grids","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Corner-point meshes are the de-facto standard format for simulation of subsurface flow. These meshes are semi-structured, but can have quite complex structure in practice due to eroded and collapsed cells and the presence of faults.

Converting the corner-points into a mesh with a connected topology is non-trivial, but the included algorithm has been verified on a number of real-field assets.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"There are two main functions to parse and process corner-point inputs:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"parse_grdecl_file\nmesh_from_grid_section","category":"page"},{"location":"#GeoEnergyIO.InputParser.parse_grdecl_file","page":"Home","title":"GeoEnergyIO.InputParser.parse_grdecl_file","text":"parse_grdecl_file(\"mygrid.grdecl\"; actnum_path = missing, kwarg...)\n\nParse a GRDECL file separately from the full input file.
